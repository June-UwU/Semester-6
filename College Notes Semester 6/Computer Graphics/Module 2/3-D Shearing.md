## 3-D Shearing

Shearing transformation is the same as we see in 2D space, but here we have to deal with the x, y, and z axes whereas in 2D we deal with the only x and y axes. Shearing is the process of slanting an object in 3D space either in x, y, or in the z-direction. Shearing changes(or deformed) the shape of the object. AS we are discussing 3D space so shearing can also be done in any of the three directions as follows. Given below are the types of shearing transformation. 

-   Shearing in X-direction. 
-   Shearing in y-direction 
-   Shearing in z-direction.

**Shearing in X-Direction:** Here the coordinate of X remains unchanged while the coordinate of Y and Z is changed. Shearing is done through the Shearing Transformation matrix, which is represented as follows.

**Shearing in Y-Direction:** Here the coordinate of Y remains unchanged while the coordinate of X and Z are changed. Shearing is done through the Shearing Transformation matrix, which is represented as follows.

**Shearing in Z-Direction:** Here the coordinate of Z remains unchanged while the coordinate of X and Y are changed. Shearing is done through the Shearing Transformation matrix, which is represented as follows for the shearing in Z-direction.
