## 3-D Translation

It is the process of changing the relative location of a 3-D object with respect to the original position by changing its coordinates. Translation transformation matrix in the 3-D image is shown as –

Where Dx, Dy, Dz are the Translation distances, let a point in 3D space is P(x, y, z) over which we want to apply Translation Transformation operation and we are given with translation distance [Dx, Dy, Dz] So, new position of the point after applying translation operation would be –
