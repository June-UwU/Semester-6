## 2-D Shearing

**Shearing** deals with changing the shape and size of the 2D object along x-axis and y-axis. It is similar to sliding the layers in one direction to change the shape of the 2D object.It is an ideal technique to change the shape of an existing object in a two dimensional plane. In a two dimensional plane, the object size can be changed along X direction as well as Y direction.

**x-Shear :**  
In x shear, the y co-ordinates remain the same but the x co-ordinates changes. If P(x, y) is the point then the new points will be P’(x’, y’) given as –

>
>$x' = x + Sh_{x} * y$
>
>$y' = y$
>

**y-Shear :**  
In y shear, the x co-ordinates remain the same but the y co-ordinates changes. If P(x, y) is the point then the new points will be P’(x’, y’) given as –

>
>$x' = x$
>
>$y' = y + Sh_{y} * x$
>

**x-y Shear :**  
In x-y shear, both the x and y co-ordinates changes. If P(x, y) is the point then the new points will be P’(x’, y’) given as –


>
>$x' = x + Sh_{x} * y$
>
>$y' = y + Sh_{y} * x$
