## 2-D Composite Transformation

A number of transformations or sequence of transformations can be combined into single one called as composition. The resulting matrix is called as composite matrix. The process of combining is called as concatenation.

Suppose we want to perform rotation about an arbitrary point, then we can perform it by the sequence of three transformations

1.  Translation
2.  Rotation
3.  Reverse Translation

The ordering sequence of these numbers of transformations must not be changed. If a matrix is represented in column form, then the composite transformation is performed by multiplying matrix in order from right to left side. The output obtained from the previous matrix is multiplied with the new coming matrix.
