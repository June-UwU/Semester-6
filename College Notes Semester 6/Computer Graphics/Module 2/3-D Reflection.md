## 3-D Reflection

Reflection in 3D space is quite similar to the reflection in 2D space, but a single difference is there in 3D, here we have to deal with **three axes (x, y, z).** Reflection is nothing but a mirror image of an object. 

Three kinds of Reflections are possible in 3D space:

-   Reflection along the X-Y plane.
-   Reflection along Y-Z plane.
-   Reflection along X-Z plane.
