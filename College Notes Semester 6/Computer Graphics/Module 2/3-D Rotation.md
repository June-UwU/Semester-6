## 3-D Rotation

Rotation in 3D is more nuanced as compared to the rotation transformation in 2D, as in 3D rotation we have to deal with 3-axes (x, y, z). 

**Rotation about** **an** **arbitrary axis**           

There are three kinds of arbitrary rotation, here we can rotate an object just parallel(or along) a specific axis so that the coordinate about which the object rotates, remains unchanged and the rest two of the coordinates get changes. There are three kinds of such rotations that are possible:

-   Rotation about the X-axis,
-   Rotation about the Y-axis,
-   Rotation about the Z-axis.

**1) Rotation about the x-axis:** In this kind of rotation, the object is rotated parallel to the **x-axis (principal axis)**, where the **x** coordinate remains unchanged and the rest of the two coordinates **y** and **z** only change.  Consider a point with initial coordinate **P(x,y,z)** in **3D space** is made to rotate parallel to the **principal axis(x-axis). The coordinate position would change to P'(x,y,z).** 

A **rotation transformation** matrix is used to calculate the new position **coordinate P’,** which shown as below:

**2) Rotation about the y-axis:** In this kind of rotation, the object is rotated parallel to the **y-axis (principal axis),** where the **y** coordinate remains unchanged and the rest of the two coordinates **x and z** only change.

**3) Rotation about the z-axis:** In this kind of rotation, the object is rotated parallel to the **z-axis** **(principal axis)**, where the **z** coordinate remains unchanged and the rest of the two coordinates **x** and **y** only change.
