## 2-D Scaling

-   Scaling may be used to increase or reduce the size of object.
-   Scaling subjects the coordinate points of the original object to change.
-   Scaling factor determines whether the object size is to be increased or reduced.
-   If scaling factor > 1, then the object size is increased.
-   If scaling factor < 1, then the object size is reduced.
