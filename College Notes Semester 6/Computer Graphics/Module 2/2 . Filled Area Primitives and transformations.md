## Filled Area Primitives and transformations

**Filled Area Primitives**: Area filling is a method or process that helps us to fill an object, area, or image. We can easily fill the polygon. The polygon filling is defined as filling or highlighting all the pixels. The pixels appear inside the polygon shape with any color other than the background.Some algorithms are :

[[Polygon Filling Algorithm]]
[[Flood Fill Algorithm]]
[[Boundary Fill Algorithm]]


### Transformations

There are four basic transformation that transforms the data to reflect certain operations,They are as follows :

1. Translations
2. Rotations
3. Scaling
4. Reflection
5. Shearing
