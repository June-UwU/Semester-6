The Cartesian slope-intercept equation for a straight line is:

$y = m * x + b$   (3-1)

with rn representing the slope of the line and b as they intercept. Given that the two endpoints of a he segment are speafied at positions (x,, y,) and (x, yJ, as shown in Fig. 3-3, we can determine values for the slope rn and y intercept b with the following calculations:

$m = \frac {y_{2} - y_{1}} {x_{2} - x_{1}}$ (3-2)

$b =y_{1} -m * x_{1}$ (3-3)

Algorithms for displaying straight hes are based on the line equation 3-1 and the calculations given in Eqs. 3-2 and 3-3. For any given x interval Ax along a line, we can compute the corresponding y interval from ~4.3-2 as

$\Delta y = m * \Delta x$  (3-4)

Similarly, wecan obtain the x interval $\Delta$x corresponding to a specified $\Delta$y as

$\Delta x = \frac{\Delta y}{m}$ (3-5)
