A cathode ray tube (CRT) is **a specialized vacuum tube in which images are produced when an electron beam strikes a phosphorescent surface**.It modulates, accelerates, and deflects electron beam(s) onto the screen to create the images.

>**Components Of A Cathode Ray Tubes** 
> 
>1. **Electron Gun:** Electron gun consisting of a series of elements, primarily a heating filament (heater) and a cathode. The electron gun creates a source of electrons which are focused into a narrow beam directed at the face of the CRT.
>
>2. **Control Electrode:** It is used to turn the electron beam on and off.
>
>3. **Focusing system:** It is used to create a clear picture by focusing the electrons into a narrow beam.
>
>4. **Deflection Yoke:** It is used to control the direction of the electron beam. It creates an electric or magnetic field which will bend the electron beam as it passes through the area. In a conventional CRT, the yoke is linked to a sweep or scan generator. The deflection yoke which is connected to the sweep generator creates a fluctuating electric or magnetic potential.
>
>5. **Phosphorus-coated screen:** The inside front surface of every CRT is coated with phosphors. Phosphors glow when a high-energy electron beam hits them. Phosphorescence is the term used to characterize the light given off by a phosphor after it has been exposed to an electron beam.
