## Role Of Lexical Analyzer

The main task of Lexical Analyzer is to read the input characters to the source program, group them into lexemes, and produce as output a sequence of tokens for each lexeme in the source program. The stream of tokens is sent to the parser for syntax analysis.It is common for the lexical analyzer to interact with the symbol table as well.When the lexical analyzer discovers a lexeme constituting an identifier,it enters that lexeme into the symbol table. In some cases , information regarding the kind of identifier may be read from the symbol table by the lexical analyzer to assist it in determining the proper token it must pass to the parser.

The lexical analyzer also might strip away the  *white spaces * and *comments*. Another might be correlating error messages generated by the compiler with error messages with the source program.Sometimes lexical analyzers are cascaded into two processes :

1. **Scanning** : consists of the simple processes that do not require tokenization of the input,such as deletions of comments and compaction of consecutive white spaces character into one.

2. **Lexical Analysis** : proper is the more complex portion, which produces tokens out of source program.
