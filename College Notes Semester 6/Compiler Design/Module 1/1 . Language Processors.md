# Language Processors
## Introductions To Compilers
A language processor is a program that translates one  language to another language.

### Compilers

A *Compiler* is a program that translates one language (source language) and translate into an equivalent program into another language (target language).An important role of compilers is to **report any error**  in the source program that occurs  during translation process.

### Interpreter

An *Interpreter* is another common language processors. Instead of producing a target program as a translation, as interpreter at mappings inputs to outputs. An interpreter appears to directly execute the operations specified in the source program on inputs supplied by the user.

The machine-language target program produced by a compiler is generally faster than an interpreter at mapping inputs to outputs. But An Interpreter , can give better error diagonistics than a compiler, because it executes the source program statement by statement.

Sometimes source program that collects source program is entrusted to a **preprocessor** .The preprocessor may also expand shorthands , called macros ,into source language statements.The modified program is fed into a compiler may produce an assembly-language program as its output, because assembly language is easier to produce output and it is easier to debug. The assembly language is  then processed by an **assembler** that produces relocatable machine code as output.

Large programs are often compiled in peices, so the relocatable machine code may have to be linked together with other relocatable object files and library files into the code that actually runs on the machine. The **Linker** resolves external memory addresses, where the code in one file may refer to another file's code. The **Loader** then puts all of the executable object files into memory for execution.
