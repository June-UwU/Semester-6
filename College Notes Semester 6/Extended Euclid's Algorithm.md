## Extended Euclid's Algorithm

In [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic "Arithmetic") and [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming"), the **extended Euclidean algorithm** is an extension to the [Euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm "Euclidean algorithm"), and computes, in addition to the [greatest common divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor "Greatest common divisor") (gcd) of integers _a_ and _b_, also the coefficients of [Bézout's identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zout%27s_identity "Bézout's identity"), which are integers _x_ and _y_ such that

>$ax + by = gcd(a,b)$

This is a [certifying algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certifying_algorithm "Certifying algorithm"), because the gcd is the only number that can simultaneously satisfy this equation and divide the inputs. It allows one to compute also, with almost no extra cost, the quotients of _a_ and _b_ by their greatest common divisor.
